# Advent of Code

This is a repository to store all my solutions to the [Advent of Code challenge](http://adventofcode.com). 

Almost all the solutions are written in Python. This was an attempt to become more familiar with Python, so most of the code is a little janky and doesn't conform to best practices.

Code in this repository is public domain, and is free for use by anyone.
